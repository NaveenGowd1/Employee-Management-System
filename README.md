Project Title: Employee Management System using Python

Description:
Developed a command-line based Employee Management System to handle basic HR operations such as adding, updating, searching, and deleting employee records. The system aims to streamline employee data management for small to medium-sized organizations.

Key Features:

Implemented core functionalities: Add, View, Update, and Delete employee records.

Stored employee data using file handling in Python (or mention if you used a database like SQLite or MySQL).

Designed a simple and user-friendly menu-driven interface for smooth navigation.

Included features like search by ID or name, display employee list, and track job roles and salaries.

Applied OOP concepts like classes and objects to maintain modular and maintainable code structure.

Skills Used:
Python, File Handling / SQLite (mention what you used), OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), Data Structures, CLI Design

Outcome:
The system helped simulate real-world HR operations and improved understanding of data management, object-oriented programming, and user interaction design in Python.

Let me know if this project included any database integration or if it was purely file-based, and I can update the description accordingly. Also, if you want a GUI version (Tkinter) or plan to expand it, I can help guide you on that too.
